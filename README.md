This project uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once - Version 8) to classify and predict different weather conditions from images. The model is trained to recognize weather classes such as **sunny**, **cloudy**, **rainy**, **sunrise**, etc., making it useful for real-time weather condition detection from live feeds or image datasets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Detect and classify weather conditions from images using the YOLOv8 deep learning object detection framework.
- **Framework Used**: [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- **Dataset**: A custom weather dataset containing labeled images of various weather types.
